This is a gui that puts a highlight on top of conflict videos to try and find
where to look where the conflict is happening.

To run it, you have to have chocolatechip installed. In order to do this,
you can cd to the top dir of chocolatechip (where the Makefile is) and then
use `make pip`

Once the library is installed, commands are available to you, such as
`chip sprinkles`. That command will look for MP4s in the directory where you're
standing and then reencode those clips to have helpful visual information.
(They will be saved in ~/sprinkle_output)
