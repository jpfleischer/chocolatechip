This unflag tool is meant to change the database
TTCTable to get rid of misclassified conflicts.
If a conflict is not actually dangerous (which is known
if the user uses the `sprinkles` tool and marks a 
video harmless), then `chip unflag` can be used while
standing in the dir with the MP4s. As long as sprinkles
generated a sprinkles.yaml, this can be used.


```bash
chip unflag
```
