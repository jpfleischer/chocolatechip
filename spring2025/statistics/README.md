i want you to clone

pip install git+<insert git repo link to chocolatechip>

in a docker contianer.

make sure that it installs without any errors.
if there are errors, we have to fix them
in the chocolatechip repository.

after you install it,
look into docker secrets.

we want to learn how to include environment variables
so that we can include the MySQL credentials.

once you do that,
we should be able to automatically make heatmaps.
in that docker container.
